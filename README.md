# React 18, @reduxjs/toolkit 1.8.1, react-redux 8, CRA template
Basic React/Typescript CRA + @reactjs/toolkit setup with SASS/SCSS for styling.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

### `yarn server`

Base simulation for **RTK-query** (so you can create some sort of API with **Redux-Toolkit**) with **json-server**.
Runs on **port 5000**, all server data in **db.json** file. Might need to install json-server globally.
